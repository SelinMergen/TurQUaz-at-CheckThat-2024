Of course if it’s an issue of black and white – even when the “victim” is a fake black person, good ol’ Al Sharpton takes up the case! \\nAs reported by Mediate: \\nAl Sharpton has some questions for Lawrence and Ruthanne Dolezal about why they waited until Friday to appear on TV to discuss their controversial daughter, Rachel Dolazel. Dolazel’s parents outed the NAACP local president as a white woman pretending to be black, and Sharpton was approached by TMZ one day later to give his thoughts. \\nWhen asked if what the Dolazel parents did was wrong, Sharpton first brought up the NAACP description of the story as a family dispute, but then said that Rachel’s parents were trying to create a distraction from her activism in social justice. \\n“On one level, you’ve got to say to her, ‘you’re misleading us’, but another level, mom and dad, come on,” Sharpton said. “Are we gonna have this dysfunctional family stuff play out and distract us from key civil rights causes? \\nSharpton then brought up the fact that Dolazel’s parents knew about their daughter’s involvement in the NAACP, saying they betrayed their daughter by waiting until she became a center of attention. “You’ve got to ask the question, ‘what are Mom and Dad’s motives here…where’ve you been?” \\nWhat are the motives, Al? Like maybe they felt it was time to expose her LIES? Al, you might have overlooked the fact she was making up false accusations of hate crimes. But of course that wouldn’t matter to you, after all you were perfectly happy to support Tawana Brawley’s false accusations. \\nI get the feeling Al really wants to accuse Dolezal’s parents of racism, because they won’t accept their daughter’s “blackness.” \\nThis whole thing is getting more absurd with every moment. \\nEmail address: \\n', 'y': 1}\n",

But since the whole ordeal happened “under his watch,” CNN’s Jake Tapper suggested that the Obama administration is&#160;largely to blame “in terms of cyber-security and foreign relations.” \\nTapper put the question before Senator&#160;Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) who responded that “it’s easy to cast blame.” \\n“In our country,” she said, “I don’t think we were ready to think that a major nation like Russia would get into this kind of mess with our own country.” \\nI think it would be naive to think that this hasn’t been going on for a long time – assuming that the Intelligence Community are being sincere in their assessments, and I admit that’s going out on a limb. Both Russia and China (and the U.S., as well as many others) have been involved in cyberattacks in other countries. But the Democrats are acting like this is the first time another country has ever done something like this to us. \\nIt was ABC News’ Jon Karl who brought up that China had hacked into the Office of Personnel Management in 2015 and had&#160; stolen the identities of over 20 million government workers. Yet, there was&#160;no&#160;response whatsoever from the White House. \\nThat hacking was by far worse than anything the Russian allegedly did. The Democrats are just upset, because Hillary Clinton didn’t win. \\nSenator Klobuchar was quick to get back to the talking point: “Do I wish we had done things differently? Yes.

            "Exception when evaluate data {'x': 'The Follies (of two widening scandals in Raleigh)\\nMore national outrage about NC GOP voter suppression efforts \\nThe controversy swirling around the efforts of the North Carolina Republican Party to make it more difficult for African-Americans to vote went national this week, with stories around the country about the memo by NC GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse urging support for local elections boards to restricting access to early voting. \\nThe move is a startling attempt by Republicans to defy the intent of the recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit&#160;that struck down the massive voter suppression law passed by the General Assembly in 2013 and signed by Gov. Pat McCrory. \\nThe court found that legislative leaders asked for data about how people vote, broken down by race, and then changed the voting methods used disproportionately by African-Americans.&#160; The intent could not have been clearer. \\nSupporters of the voter suppression law, including McCrory, have yet to explain why legislators needed the breakdown by race of which voting methods people used. That’s because there is no explanation other than they were trying to suppress the African-American vote. \\nThe General Assembly, with McCrory’s endorsement, imposed a photo ID requirement at the polls, ended same day registration, reduced the number of days for early voting, and ended pre-registration for 16 and 17 year olds. \\nThe court decision throwing out most of the law said lawmakers used “surgical precision” to target minority voters and now those same offensive efforts have moved to local elections boards, many of which are refusing to allow early voting on Sunday or declining to locate early voting sites in minority neighborhoods or on college campuses. \\nMany local boards are also considering only having one site open for the seven days of early voting that the law eliminated and the decision by the 4th Circuit restored. \\nMecklenburg County Board of Elections Chair Mary Potter Summa openly declared a recent meeting that she is “not a fan of early voting.” \\nWoodhouse’s memo, called a smoking gun by one prominent national news site, raises the profile of the voter suppression effort and makes it a campaign issue that might effect this fall’s elections. \\nIt also lays bare the motivation of the NC GOP, the General Assembly, and Gov. McCrory. \\nThey are doing all they can to make it harder for African-Americans to vote. That is clear in ruling of the 4th Circuit and in the outrageous and undemocratic decisions being made by Republican boards of elections. \\nMore', 'y': 0}\n",

President Bush first blocked a U.S. contribution to UNFPA in 2002, and has every year since, on the grounds that the agency violates the anticoercion law by virtue of its mere presence in China, despite the fact that the administration’s own investigative team found no evidence to support this claim. UNFPA operates in over 150 poor countries around the world, but does not provide or pay for abortion services anywhere in the world. Instead, UNFPA works to reduce the need for abortion by promoting voluntary family planning. \\nClick on the links below for more information. \\nU.S. funding for UNFPA \\nThe Bush Administration’s policies on sexual and reproductive health worldwide \\nThe broad benefits of international family planning programs for women and children', 'y': 0}\n",

            "Exception when evaluate data {'x': 'Peter King Sides With Passion Over Principle\\n \\nI don’t need to tell conservatives that Peter King is poison. But the recent story in Politico.com gives us a pretty clear picture about what is wrong with him. It also might provide us with a window into Obama’s recent temper tantrum in using government money to shut down national parks as part of the “shutdown.” \\n“His current breach with the national GOP stems from a profoundly resonant local issue: aid for Hurricane Sandy, aid for which the House delayed approving and ultimately cleared against opposition from dozens of his Republican colleagues. At the time, King called on New York donors to snub the National Republican Congressional Committee; he has denounced Republican opponents of Sandy aid, such as Cruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who have visited the Empire State since then. That wound is clearly still raw for King, who alluded in the interview to how ‘politicians walk around with their arms around each other saying how much they love their colleague, like guys always did to me until they screwed me on Sandy.’ He noted that Colorado Republicans who opposed Sandy relief didn’t have any reservations about seeking federal money for flood aid in their state.” \\nI actually sympathize with King about watching Colorado appeal for aid. Of course, New York actually did get federal aid—just not as much as fast as King wanted. So the comparison doesn’t sound as dire to me as it does to him. Still I can see why it feels galling. There are real and/or perceived regional injustices behind King’s words and actions. His backer, former Senator Al D’Amato is quoted as saying, “the Northeast in particular [isn’t] held in high esteem by some of our Republican colleagues.” \\nOK, but so what? \\nKing isn’t supposed to be governing according to his resentments.

While construction of the Keystone XL pipeline was rejected last month, several amendments to S. 1 address opinions about climate change more generally. One such amendment, S. Amdt. 58, expresses the sense of Congress that “ human activity significantly contributes to climate change.” &#160;The amendment, which required a two-thirds majority to pass, failed by a vote of 50-49.

            "Exception when evaluate data {'x': 'Video proof of voter fraud in D.C.\\nPresident Obama and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department have a new obsession to obstruct any state’s passing of voter-identification laws, even recently attacking South Carolina and my own state of Texas. Holder calls voter ID laws “unnecessary” and says voter fraud “doesn’t exist,” but new video proof in his own voting precinct proves otherwise. \\nObama’s administration says they’re against voter ID laws because they are valiantly trying to keep minorities and the poor from being unfairly discriminated against. But the truth is that they are trying to keep President Obama in office. They know that voter IDs are bad business for this White House’s campaign and re-election. \\nIn the last couple weeks, video proof from Holder’s own voting precinct in Washington, D.C., revealed voter fraud is alive and well in the nation’s capital. On primary election day, April 3, a representative from James O’Keefe’s nonprofit organization Project Veritas simply strolled into the polling place and was offered the ballot for U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder after merely stating his name and address. Though not being asked for ID, O’Keefe’s assistant added that he forgot his ID, to which the poll worker retorted, “You don’t need it. It’s all right. As long as you’re in here, you’re on our list, and that’s who you say you are, you’re OK.” \\nO’Keefe’s assistant then replied, “I would feel more comfortable if I just had my ID. Is it all right if I go get it?” After the poll worker agreed, O’Keefe’s assistant said as he walked away, “I’ll be back faster than you can say furious,” playing on the scandalous Fast and Furious gun-smuggling debacle by Holder’s Department of Justice. \\nOf course, rather than confessing to culpability or that there might be a flaw in the election process, the District of Columbia Board of Elections announced last week that it was launching an investigation to possibly bring charges against Project Veritas. \\nAs CitizenLink reported, the D.C. Board of Elections spokesperson Alysoun McLaughlin carefully spun her political rebuttal: “We’re very concerned about any kind of activity that occurs in a polling place where someone is misrepresenting themselves or otherwise ob', 'y': 1}\n",
